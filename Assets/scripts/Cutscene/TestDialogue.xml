				<text>For the purposes of this alpha build, you have 100 gold coins in your bank. Spend them wisely to keep the heroes out!</text>
				<text>Select a type of MINION or TRAP to place in the dungeon with the number keys, and CLICK anywhere in the dungeon to spent 10 gold and place your choice. Hallways don't count!</text>
			</speaker>

			<speaker character="Magenta">
				<text>When you've spent all your gold, click on [START WAVE] to bring forth the heroes! You win if you can rout them all.</text>
				<text>And if you don't want to spend everything at the beginning, don't worry! You can still purchase minions or traps mid-wave.</text>
